        "# Qno 1 : discuss string slicing and provide examples .\n",
        "Answer : String slicing in Python is a technique used to extract a part (or \"slice\") of a string using a specific syntax.\n",
        "The syntax for string slicing is:\n",
        "\n",
        "string[start:stop:step]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parameters:\n",
        "1. **`start`**: The index where the slice starts (inclusive). The default is `0`.\n",
        "2. **`stop`**: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the end of the string.\n",
        "3. **`step`**: The number of steps to take between each character in the slice. The default is `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Notes:\n",
        "- **Indexing starts at `0`**, so the first character in a string has index `0`.\n",
        "- **Negative indices** can be used to count from the end of the string. For example, `-1` refers to the last character.\n",
        "- If you **omit parameters**, Python uses default values:\n",
        "  - Omitting `start` defaults to the beginning of the string.\n",
        "  - Omitting `stop` defaults to the end of the string.\n",
        "  - Omitting `step` defaults to `1` (meaning every character is included).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Basic Slicing\n",
        "```python\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"Hello\"\n",
        "slice_1 = text[0:5]  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"World\"\n",
        "slice_2 = text[7:12]  # Output: 'World'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"Hello, World\"\n",
        "slice_3 = text[:12]  # Output: 'Hello, World'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"World!\" (from index 7 to the end)\n",
        "slice_4 = text[7:]  # Output: 'World!'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using Negative Indices\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Extract the last character\n",
        "slice_5 = text[-1]  # Output: '!'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract the last 6 characters\n",
        "slice_6 = text[-6:]  # Output: 'World!'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"Hello\" using negative indices\n",
        "slice_7 = text[:-7]  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using Step\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Extract every second character\n",
        "slice_8 = text[::2]  # Output: 'Hlo ol!'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reverse the string\n",
        "slice_9 = text[::-1]  # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH'\n",
        "\n",
        "# Extract \"loW\" (step by 2)\n",
        "slice_10 = text[3:10:2]  # Output: 'loW'\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Empty Slice\n",
        "If `start` and `stop` define a range that doesn't exist (e.g., `start` is greater than `stop`), it will return an empty string:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Empty slice\n",
        "slice_11 = text[5:2]  # Output: ''\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases\n",
        "1. **Extracting substrings** from larger text.\n",
        "2. **Reversing a string**: `string[::-1]`.\n",
        "3. **Skipping characters**: e.g., extract every third character using a step of `3`.\n",
        "4. **Trimming**: remove the first or last few characters."

        "# Qno 2: explain the key feature  of list in python .\n",
        "Answer : VLists in Python are a versatile and commonly used data structure that stores an ordered collection of items (elements),\n",
        " which can be of any type (e.g., integers, strings, floats, other lists).\n",
        " Here are the **key features** of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Ordered**\n",
        "   - Lists maintain the order of the elements. The position (index) of each element is fixed, and you can access elements by their index.\n",
        "   - For example:\n",
        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
        "     print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10 (first element)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Mutable**\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, which means you can change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.\n",
        "   - Example of modifying a list:\n",
        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
        "     my_list[1] = 25  # Changing the second element\n",
        "     print(my_list)   # Output: [10, 25, 30, 40]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Dynamic Size**\n",
        "   - Lists can grow or shrink in size. You can add elements using methods like `append()` and `extend()` and remove them using `remove()` or `pop()`.\n",
        "   - Example of adding and removing:\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list.append(4)  # Add 4 to the end\n",
        "     print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "     my_list.pop()      # Remove the last element\n",
        "     print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Heterogeneous**\n",
        "   - A list can store elements of different types. It can hold integers, strings, floats, and even other lists (nested lists).\n",
        "   - Example of a heterogeneous list:\n",
        "     mixed_list = [1, \"apple\", 3.14, [2, 4, 6]]\n",
        "     print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'apple', 3.14, [2, 4, 6]]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Indexing and Slicing**\n",
        "   - You can access individual elements using indexing. Negative indices allow you to access elements from the end of the list.\n",
        "   - You can also extract a part of the list using slicing.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",
        "     print(my_list[2])      # Output: 'c' (third element)\n",
        "     print(my_list[-1])     # Output: 'e' (last element)\n",
        "     print(my_list[1:4])    # Output: ['b', 'c', 'd']\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Built-in Methods**\n",
        "   - Lists come with several built-in methods to make operations easy, such as:\n",
        "     - **`append(x)`**: Adds `x` to the end of the list.\n",
        "     - **`extend(iterable)`**: Extends the list by appending all elements from the iterable.\n",
        "     - **`insert(i, x)`**: Inserts `x` at index `i`.\n",
        "     - **`remove(x)`**: Removes the first occurrence of `x`.\n",
        "     - **`pop([i])`**: Removes and returns the element at index `i` (default is the last element).\n",
        "     - **`sort()`**: Sorts the list in ascending order.\n",
        "     - **`reverse()`**: Reverses the elements of the list in place.\n",
        "     - **`index(x)`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of `x`.\n",
        "     - **`count(x)`**: Returns the number of times `x` appears in the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example of using some methods:\n",
        "     fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        "     fruits.append('date')        # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
        "     fruits.remove('banana')      # ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
        "     fruits.insert(1, 'blueberry')  # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **List Comprehensions**\n",
        "   - Python provides a concise way to create lists using list comprehensions. It's a shorthand for generating lists.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
        "     print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Nested Lists**\n",
        "   - Lists can contain other lists, allowing you to create multi-dimensional (nested) lists.\n",
        "   - Example of a 2D list (matrix):\n",
        "     matrix = [\n",
        "         [1, 2, 3],\n",
        "         [4, 5, 6],\n",
        "         [7, 8, 9]\n",
        "     ]\n",
        "     print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6 (second row, third column)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Iteration**\n",
        "   - You can loop through the elements of a list using a `for` loop or `while` loop.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "     for item in my_list:\n",
        "         print(item)\n",
        "     # Output:\n",
        "     # 10\n",
        "     # 20\n",
        "     # 30\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **Support for Common Operations**\n",
        "   - Lists support common operations like concatenation, repetition, and membership checks:\n",
        "     - **Concatenation**: `list1 + list2`\n",
        "     - **Repetition**: `list * 3`\n",
        "     - **Membership**: `x in list`\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     b = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "     combined = a + b  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
        "     repeated = a * 2  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     is_in = 2 in a    # Output: True\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",

        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Performance**\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are generally faster than lists because of their immutability. They require less memory and have a smaller memory footprint.\n",
        "   - **Lists** are slightly slower due to their mutability, which requires additional operations to support modifications.\n",

        "In performance-critical applications, tuples can be preferred when the data set does not need to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Use Cases**\n",
        "   - **Lists** are used when the data can change over time, and you need the flexibility to modify elements (like appending or deleting).\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are ideal for fixed collections of items (like coordinates, database records, or items you don’t want accidentally modified).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **5. Methods Available**\n",
        "   - **Lists** have many built-in methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.).\n",
        "   - **Tuples** have fewer methods since they are immutable. The main methods are `count()` (to count occurrences of an element) and `index()` (to find the index of an element).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "# List methods\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 2 (index of the number '3')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Packing and Unpacking**\n",
        "   - **Both lists and tuples** support packing (grouping multiple values into a single variable) and unpacking (extracting multiple values from a single variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Examples:\n",
        "# Nested list\n",

        "\n",
        "### **8. Immutability and Hashability**\n",
        "   - **Tuples** are hashable (if they contain only hashable items) and can be used as dictionary keys or elements of a set.\n",

        "#Qno 5 :  describe the key features of sets and provide examplesof their use .\n",
        "Answer : Sets in Python are a built-in data structure that represents an **unordered** collection of unique elements.\n",
        "They are useful when you need to store a collection of items without duplicates, and they provide efficient operations for membership tests, union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features of Sets**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unordered Collection**\n",
        "   - Sets do not maintain any specific order. Elements are stored in an arbitrary order, so you cannot access items by index or perform slicing.\n",
        "   - This unordered nature makes sets fast for certain operations, such as checking if an element is in the set.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No Duplicates**\n",
        "   - Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. If you add a duplicate item to a set, it is ignored.\n",
        "   - This makes sets a great choice for filtering out repeated items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mutable (Except `frozenset`)**\n",
        "   - Standard sets in Python are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after the set is created.\n",
        "   - There is also an immutable version of a set called a `frozenset`, which cannot be changed once created.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficient Membership Testing**\n",
        "   - Sets are optimized for membership testing (checking if an item exists in the set) due to their internal implementation using hash tables.\n",
        "   This makes operations like `in` very fast compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Mathematical Set Operations**\n",
        "   - Sets support standard set operations like **union**, **intersection**, **difference**, and **symmetric difference**.\n",
        "   - These operations can be done using both operators and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Creating a Set**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets can be created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.\n",

        "#### 4. **Symmetric Difference**\n",
        "   - Returns a new set with elements in either set, but not in both.\n",
        "   - Use `^` operator or `symmetric_difference()` method.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Fixed Data Collections**\n",
        "   - Tuples are used when you need to store a collection of values that should not change throughout the program.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Dictionary Keys**\n",
        "   - Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (as long as they contain only hashable elements).\n",
        "   This makes them useful for scenarios where you need to create a composite key.\n",

        "   - Sets automatically remove duplicates, making them ideal for situations where you need to filter unique items from a collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Removing duplicates from a list\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Membership Testing**\n",
        "   - Sets are optimized for fast membership testing due to their internal hash table implementation.\n",
        "    This makes checking if an item is in a set (`in` operation) much faster than checking in a list, especially for large collections.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Mathematical Set Operations**\n",
        "   - Sets are perfect for performing mathematical operations such as **union**, **intersection**, **difference**, and **symmetric difference**.\n",
        "   These operations are very efficient compared to performing the same tasks with lists.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Filtering Data**\n",
        "   - Sets are useful for filtering and deduplicating data. For example, you can use a set to track unique user actions or to quickly compare large data sets.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Handling Large Data Sets**\n",
        "   - Sets are efficient for handling large data sets where operations like finding intersections, unions, and differences are frequent.\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Comparing two large data sets\n",

        "   - Python dictionaries are implemented using **hash tables**, which are optimized for quick look-ups, insertions, and deletions. To use an object as a key in a dictionary, it must be **hashable**.\n",
        "   - An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its lifetime.\n",

        "   - When dealing with geographical data, you might use coordinates as keys. Using tuples ensures the coordinates remain fixed.\n",
        "   # Dictionary with coordinates as keys\n",
        "   geo_data = {\n",
        "       (40.7128, -74.0060): 'New York',\n",

        "3. **Caching and Memoization**\n",
        "   - Tuples are often used as keys in caching scenarios (e.g., memoization of function results) where function arguments are stored as keys for quick look-up of previously computed results.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Example of using a tuple for memoization\n",
        "   cache = {}\n",
        "\n",
        "   def expensive_computation(a, b):\n",
        "       # Use a tuple of (a, b) as the key\n",
        "       if (a, b) not in cache:\n",
        "           cache[(a, b)] = a ** b  # Store the result in the cache\n",
        "       return cache[(a, b)]\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Computation is cached\n",
        "   print(expensive_computation(2, 10))  # Output: 1024\n",

        "### **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable dictionary keys are crucial because they provide consistent and reliable behavior for dictionary operations, which depend on stable hash values.\n",
        " This consistency leads to better performance, predictable look-ups, and data integrity. Immutable keys (like strings, numbers, and tuples) are thus safe to use,\n",
        " while mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, or sets) are not suitable for dictionary keys in Python."
